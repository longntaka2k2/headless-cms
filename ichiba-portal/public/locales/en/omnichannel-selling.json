        "title": "What is the difference between omnichannel and multichannel?",
        "content": "While omnichannel and multichannel are similar, they’re not the same thing. An omnichannel experience is where brick-and-mortar stores and a business' online operations work in tandem with one another. On the flip side, multichannel retail is where a business has both physical and online stores but their operations are siloed into separate channels instead of being integrated."

      {
        "title": "How does omnichannel software work?",
        "content": "Omnichannel software coordinates all your selling channels so they work together seamlessly - whether that’s a website, mobile app, or in-store physical location. Using omnichannel software, retailers can access customer information from any channel and connect with these customers on any channel (via automation). On top of that, omnichannel software leverages CRM data to deliver personalized user experiences on any channel along the customer journey."
      },
      {
        "title": "How can businesses ensure a consistent brand experience across channels?",
        "content": "Ensuring a consistent brand experience involves maintaining uniform branding elements, messaging, and customer service standards across all channels. Businesses should integrate their marketing efforts, align product information, and train staff to deliver a cohesive experience irrespective of the channel."
