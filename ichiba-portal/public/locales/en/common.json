Thanks to IChiba, I have reduced lots of time and effort in tracking orders to have more time to research and develop products. I hope IChiba OnePlatform can connect more carriers in the world in the future.",
    "customerSayContent1": "IChiba OnePlatform has helped improve accuracy no end, and it also integrates seamlessly with our shipping provider, so although we have a much higher volume of orders, we’re processing and shipping them at a faster rate than ever before. It's time to say bye to the tracking dashboard of each carrier, as we can track & trace my order status anytime, anywhere on a dashboard now.",
    "customerSayContent2": "Ship4P has allowed us to grow our carrier network, brought our customers a wide range of shipping options to every corner of the world with the best condition, as well as enabled Toro's customer service team to have full visibility on all customer orders in one easy-to-use platform.",
    "customerSayContent3": "Because wholesale orders are in the pipeline for longer than those cusomers coming to us via a DC channel, it adds an extra layer of complexity to order fulfillment. However, Brightpearl automatically updates each sales channel in realtime with information on what products are available. And its single source of truth means I can dip into the platform at any time to quickly get an overview of our inventory, order fulfillment and sales across channels, which is so important to removing potential bottlenecks in our operation.",
